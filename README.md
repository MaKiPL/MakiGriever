Currently only the importers work. 

Unity: **Unity 6 (6000.0.32f1)**

1. Clone the project
2. Open via Unity
3. Rename the objects (because I can't register ".obj" importer due to Unity limitations and their native importer shit)
4. Drag and drop the objects onto Unity editor. Voila!


# Currently supported objects:
1. Worldmap Texl (rename as `.texl` extension)
2. Worldmap wmx (rename as `.wmx` extension)

  
**See attached samples in SampleAssets - there are original, renamed files**
